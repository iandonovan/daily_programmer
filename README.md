A collection of challenges from reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer

Nuggets.rb is a small script I wrote to help a friend; it's not particularly thrilling, but it's documented well enough that I figured I'd keep it.

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a three-part challenge from Reddit's Daily Programmer subreddit. Part One is available here: http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/23lfrf/4212014_challenge_159_easy_rock_paper_scissors/, where part two is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/23qy19/4232014_challenge_159_intermediate_rock_paper/
